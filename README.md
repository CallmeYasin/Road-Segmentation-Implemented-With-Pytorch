=====
What is Image Segmentation?
At its core, image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments, or "regions of interest" (ROIs). The goal is to simplify the image's representation into something more meaningful and easier to analyze.
This project is based on these main resources:
1) <b>U-Net<b> : [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597).
2) Modern computer vision with Pytorch book:[Amazon Website](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Computer-Vision-PyTorch-comprehensive/dp/1803231335).
3) <b>Vgg16<b>:[Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556).



## 🗺️ *The path to be taken to build this project*
```
Load dataset and apply mask annotations on them and create mask images
↓
Preproccess and visualize images and masks and put them in dataloader
↓
Define model architecture and use vgg16 as a backbone for feature extraction
↓
Define two metrics,IoU(Intersection over Union) and Dice score for evaluation
↓
Train model to learn patterns and decrease loss and increase dice score
↓
Use Fast API and use for prediction
↓
Project has been completed!
