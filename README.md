# 🚀 Complete Road Seqmentation And A Segmentation Dataset Available

### 🤖 **The path to be taken to build this project**
```
Load dataset and apply mask annotations on them and create mask images
↓
Preproccess and visualize images and masks and put them in dataloader
↓
Define model architecture and use vgg16 as a backbone for feature extraction
↓
Define two metrics,IoU(Intersection over Union) and Dice score for evaluation
↓
Train model to learn patterns and decrease loss and increase dice score
↓
Use Fast API and use for prediction
↓
Project has been completed!
